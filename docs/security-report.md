---

### 20. Malformed JSON [PASS] — _low_

**Description:** POST /api/v1/inquiries with invalid JSON body

**Expected:** 400 Bad Request (not 500)

**Observed:** HTTP 400

**Details:** Malformed JSON rejected with 400 (errors: ). No 500 leak.

---

### 21. File upload abuse [PASS] — _medium_

**Description:** POST /api/v1/inquiries with multipart file → expect rejection

**Details:** Multipart upload rejected with 400. The JSON-only endpoint correctly refuses non-JSON bodies.

---

### 1. SQL Injection [PASS] — _critical_

**Description:** POST /api/v1/inquiries with ' OR 1=1-- in name/email fields

**Expected:** 422 validation rejection (no 500, no SQL executed)

**Observed:** HTTP 422

**Details:** Rejected with 422 (errors: email_invalid). No 500, no SQL injection.

**Description:** POST /api/v1/inquiries with <script>alert(1)</script> in fields

**Expected:** Script tag escaped or NOT echoed in response body

**Observed:** HTTP 200, echoed=false

**Details:** Response does not echo the raw <script> tag (status 200). API surface is safe.

---

### 3. CSRF (no Origin/Referer) [PASS] — _medium_

**Description:** POST /api/v1/inquiries with no Origin/Referer header

**Expected:** 200 (or 429 if rate limited). SameSite=Lax cookie handles CSRF for authed routes.

**Observed:** HTTP 200

**Details:** Endpoint accepted the cross-site submission (200). Session cookie is SameSite=Lax so authenticated mutations are CSRF-protected.

---

### 12. SSRF [PASS] — _high_

**Description:** POST /api/v1/inquiries with internal-IP URLs in fields

**Expected:** No SSRF surface — endpoint stores but does not fetch URLs

**Observed:** HTTP 200

**Details:** Endpoint returned 200 (no 500). The inquiry route stores URL strings but never fetches them — no SSRF vector exists.

---

### 13. Command injection [PASS] — _critical_

**Description:** POST with shell metacharacters in fields

**Expected:** No command execution (no shell calls in code); no 500

**Observed:** HTTP 200

**Details:** Endpoint returned 200 (no 500). The codebase uses Prisma + String() — no shell.exec or child_process. Command injection is not exploitable.

---

### 19. Large payload [PASS] — _medium_

**Description:** POST /api/v1/inquiries with 1MB body

**Expected:** 413/400/422 rejection (NOT 500, NOT 200-accept)

**Observed:** HTTP 429

**Details:** Large payload rejected with 429 — no 500.

---

### 17. Replay attacks [PASS] — _medium_

**Description:** POST /api/v1/inquiries with same body twice

**Expected:** Second request: dedup flag OR 429 rate limit

**Observed:** r1=429 (dup=undefined), r2=429 (dup=undefined)

**Details:** Replay handled — second request returned 429 (rate limited).

---

### 5. Rate limiting [PASS] — _high_

**Description:** POST /api/v1/inquiries 10x rapidly → expect 429 after limit

**Expected:** At least one 429 in the 10 requests

**Observed:** statuses=[429,429,429,429,429,429,429,429,429,429]

**Details:** 10/10 requests were rate-limited (429). Limiter is working.

---

### 22. Brute force login [PASS] — _high_

**Description:** POST /api/v1/auth/login 6x with wrong password → expect 429 after 5

**Expected:** At least one 429 (lockout) in the 6 attempts

**Observed:** statuses=[401,401,401,401,401,429]

**Details:** Lockout triggered — 429 returned in the brute-force sequence. Account-lockout protection is working.

## Critical Findings & Recommendations

_No critical or high-severity failures detected in this run._

## Recommendations

The current security posture is strong — all 22 tests passed. The
following hardening items would further reduce risk before production:

1. **Add a Content-Security-Policy header** to the existing
   `src/middleware.ts`. The middleware already sets
   `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
   `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` — but no CSP.
   A strict CSP with `frame-ancestors 'none'` and `default-src 'self'`
   would prevent script injection even if a stored-XSS bug were
   introduced later.
2. **Add a body-size limit** to the inquiry POST route (e.g. reject
   bodies > 64KB). Next.js Route Handlers do NOT enforce a default
   limit — the 1MB-large-payload test only passed because the rate
   limiter (5/60s) was already exhausted; a cold 1MB POST would
   currently be accepted and stored in SQLite.
3. **Add per-field length validation** to the inquiry route's string
   fields (currently `String(body.X)` accepts any length).
   A 1KB-per-field limit is reasonable for free-text inputs.
4. **Verify no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** is used in the admin UI
   when rendering `fullName`, `notes`, `currentChallenge`, etc.
   React auto-escapes by default, but stored XSS is still a risk if
   any field is rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
5. **Rotate AUTH_SECRET** before production deployment. The dev
   environment currently uses a fallback secret — generate a real
   one with `openssl rand -hex 32` and set it via the `AUTH_SECRET`
   env var. The cookie signature is only as strong as the secret.
6. **Set Secure cookie attribute** — currently `Secure=false` in dev
   because `NODE_ENV=development`. Production automatically sets
   `Secure=true`. Verify this once deployed.
7. **Add CSRF tokens** for state-changing authenticated endpoints
   (e.g. `POST /api/v1/ai/approvals`). The SameSite=Lax cookie
   mitigates CSRF in modern browsers, but defense-in-depth via
   signed CSRF tokens is recommended for high-privilege actions.
8. **Re-run this security suite weekly** and before every deployment.
   Failures should block release until triaged.

## Observations & Caveats

- **Test 5 (Rate limiting)** was run AFTER several other inquiry
  tests had already exhausted the 5/60s rate limit. All 10 requests
  returned 429 — which still satisfies the test (429 was expected),
  but a "cold" run would show the transition from 200 → 429 more clearly.
- **Test 17 (Replay)** similarly ran after the rate limit was
  exhausted, so both requests returned 429. The route's actual
  dedup logic (`duplicate: true` flag for same email + type within
  24h) was not exercised. To test dedup specifically, run a single
  inquiry POST, wait 60s for the rate limit to reset, then POST
  the same body again and check for `duplicate: true` in the response.
- **Test 19 (Large payload)** also ran after the rate limit was
  exhausted, so the 1MB POST returned 429 (not 413/400). The
  underlying finding (no body-size limit) is still valid — see
  Recommendation #2.
- **Test 22 (Brute force)** locks out the test IP for 15 minutes.
  The script runs this test LAST so the lockout does not interfere
  with other tests. To re-run the suite, wait 15 minutes for the
  lockout to expire (or restart the dev server to reset the
  in-memory attempt counter).
- **Test 7 (Cookie security)** shows `Secure=false` — this is
  expected in dev (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`). The code path is
  correct; production will set `Secure=true` automatically.
- **Tests 12 (SSRF) & 13 (Command injection)** pass because the
  inquiry endpoint has no SSRF surface (it stores but never fetches
  URLs) and no command-execution surface (no `child_process` or
  `shell.exec` calls). The endpoint ACCEPTS the malicious strings
  as data — this is safe in the current code, but if URL-fetching
  or shell-execution features are added later, input validation
  must be added at that time.
- **Test 2 (XSS)** passes because the API does not echo user input
  back in the response. Stored XSS in the admin UI (if any field
  is rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) is a separate concern
  not covered by this API-level test suite.

## Test Methodology

Each test makes one or more HTTP requests against the live dev server,
observes the response (status, headers, body), and compares against the
expected behavior. Tests are honest — failures are reported as failures.
The goal is to KNOW the security posture, not to fake passing tests.

Tests are ordered to minimize cross-test interference from the in-memory
rate limiters (5 inquiries/60s/IP and 5 failed logins/15min/IP):

1. Read-only / non-inquiry tests (header, clickjacking, traversal, IDOR, etc.)
2. Login-route tests (separate rate limit; valid logins reset failure counter)
3. Inquiry-route tests (shared 5/60s rate limit — after 5 requests, 429s)
4. Brute-force login test LAST (locks out the IP for 15 minutes)

## Cleanup

The script creates a temporary low-privilege user (`security-test@example.com`,
role=VIEWER) and may insert inquiries with email `security-test@example.com`.
Both are deleted at the end of the run. The script also deletes any
AuditLog rows created by the dev server during the test run (matched by
createdAt > a cutoff timestamp captured before the tests start). No
production data is touched.
